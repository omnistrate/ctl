## omnistrate-ctl build

Build Services from image, compose spec or service plan spec

### Synopsis

Build command can be used to build a service from image, docker compose, and service plan spec.
It has two main modes of operation:

- Create a new service plan
- Update an existing service plan

Below info served as service plan identifiers:

- service name (--product-name, required)
- environment name (--environment, optional, default: Dev)
- environment type (--environment-type, optional, default: dev)
- service plan name (the name field of x-omnistrate-service-plan tag in compose spec file, required)
  If the identifiers match an existing service plan, it will update that plan. Otherwise, it'll create a new service plan.

This command has an interactive mode. In this mode, you can choose to promote the service plan to production by interacting with the prompts.

```
omnistrate-ctl build [--file=file] [--spec-type=spec-type] [--product-name=service-name] [--description=service-description] [--service-logo-url=service-logo-url] [--environment=environment-name] [--environment-type=environment-type] [--release] [--release-as-preferred] [--release-description=release-description][--interactive] [--image=image-url] [--image-registry-auth-username=username] [--image-registry-auth-password=password] [--env-var="key=var"] [flags]
```

### Examples

```

omctl build --spec-type ServicePlanSpec --file service-spec.yml --product-name "My Service"

# Build service with service specification for Helm, Operator or Kustomize in prod environment
omctl build --spec-type ServicePlanSpec --file service-spec.yml --product-name "My Service" --environment prod --environment-type prod
